# Candace's Submission for the IVIM coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and styled using a mix of [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction) and inline styling.



## Comments

I spent a little more time on this than the prompt allowed, 1.5 hours, not including git manangement, and writing this document, but I wanted to make sure the minimal functionality was added.

If I continued to work on this project, I would:
- incorporate IVIM's color pallet into backgrounds and text by theming React Bootstrap.
- add a scaling hover effect to the cards as well as a transition to make the scale and color change smoother
- clean up the layout of the footer
- make the 'View Meal' button sticky to the bottom right of the screen for easy access
- touch up the styling of the modal
